# CPU-SCHEDULING_IMPLEMENTATION

## Notes

- Be mindful of naming conventions, to be uniform we will be using snake case. Example: shabu_dealers
- Type hints good very very helpful

## Phases

1. Python Implementation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms
2. Javascript translation of Python Code
3. Design of Webpage using Figma or some other software
4. Component Creation
5. Tweaks and Maintenance

## Phase: 1

FCFS Sort done</br>
SPF Sort done</br>
SRTF Sort done</br>
Turnaround and Waiting Time done</br>
Reuse modules for SPF and SRTF</br>
Testing and Bug fixing </br>

## Phase: 2

Utilize javascript functions to translate python code done </br>

## Phase: 3

## Current Phase: 4

- TaskComponent Done
- Base Functionalities Done
- work on error catchers with alert component, work on gantt chart soon and aT and wT tables soon
