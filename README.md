## Notes

- Be mindful of naming conventions, to be uniform we will be using snake case. Example: shabu_dealers
- Type hints good very very helpful

## Phases

1. Python Implementation of CPU Scheduling Algorithms
2. Javascript translation of Python Code
3. Design of Webpage using Figma or some other software
4. Component Creation
5. Tweaks and Maintenance

## Current Phase: 1

FCFS Sort done</br>
